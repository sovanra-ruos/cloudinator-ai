# Gemini Code Generator Web Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application built with React.js that displays the 'Gemini Code Generator' text and likely includes a component for code generation (which would need to be implemented separately).

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the application.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file (using React).
- `components/CodeGenerator.js`:  A placeholder for the code generation component (needs implementation). 

## To-Do

- Implement the `CodeGenerator` component to handle code generation functionality.
- Add more robust styling.
- Enhance error handling and user feedback.
